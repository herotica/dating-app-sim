## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

- Recommended `node` : `>=16.13.0`
- `npm` or `pnpm` or `yarn`

I advice to use `pnpm` for managing dependencies. It's faster and more reliable than `npm`. To install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) just run:

- `corepack enable`
- `corepack prepare pnpm@7.0.0-rc.3 --activate`

After that the syntax is the same as `npm` e.g. `npm install` becomes `pnpm install`.

### Setup

1. Download or fork this project
2. Extract the content to a new directory, rename it and cd the directory.
3. Install all dependencies using:

- `npm install` or `pnpm install` or `yarn`

## Scripts

### Start dev server

- `npm run dev` or `pnpm run dev` or `yarn run dev` and open the browser at `http://localhost:3000`

### Build for production

- `npm run build` or `pnpm run build` or `yarn run build`

### Locally preview production build

After creating the production build, run:

- `npm run preview` or `yarn run preview`

### Start server

- `npm run serve` or `pnpm run serve` or `yarn run serve` and open the browser at `http://localhost:4173`
